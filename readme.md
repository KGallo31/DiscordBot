Hello! 
This bot has a very specific job. With a specifed steam workshop users item workshop list, it will find the total entires and return the amount with a discord message. 
That was really the only use I wanted out of this bot and it does exactly that for the user in the url (Haven't really tried with other uses but it works with the one I want so whatever).
The bot must be added to the server. After that it mst be turned on by using the `nodemon` command in the terminal. This will start the bot. 
Now any time someone says `wake up sped` it will reply with the total amount of entries of the user.
